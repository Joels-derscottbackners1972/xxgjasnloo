Man. Where do I even start? Just walked out of 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 Marching Powder and wow, my head's spinnng, like one of those old dental drills before you knew better… you know? It's like they jammed all the chaos from this wild 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮 into my brain, and now it's a popcorn whirlwind up there. Popcorn – damn, I’m sitting on some. 

The theater was loud, like really LOUD, with this stupid sticky floor making every step a gamble. There’s this one scene, god, they're running through the prison halls so fast it felt like you were hovering over it all, kinda like when the dentist gets too close to your comfort zone. Weird but thrilling. 

> There was this part, where he’s diving deep into this world of deceit and I swear, my back started to ache just 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨, like I've been drilled into my seat by some invisible force. Too much tension, like when you're trying not to sneeze while doing a filling.

Oh, and the visuals – like someone just threw paint at the screen. But not in a bad way, more like when you spill mouthwash and it somehow looks artistic, with all those blues and greens, swirling.

It sticks with you. I should probably tell Ryan, if he still wants to 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the  , brace for those twists. They come at you like a sudden shot of novocaine to the gum – unexpected and sharp.

Anyway, I moved the crumb-covered seat before realizing I'd forgotten my jacket. And my keys, handy as a toothpick you don’t need. Hello?? Is this still recording? Hope not. this piecemeal thought is as organized as a mouthful of misaligned teeth.

int RandomSceneGenerator() {
     // or not, what even is this? 
     return -1; // 

Feels fitting, doesn’t it? Like everything else, around today, slightly off the rails.
